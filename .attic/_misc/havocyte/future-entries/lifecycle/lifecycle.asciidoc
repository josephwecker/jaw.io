Involve the "public" the whole time, so no separate "release"

Most things won't have and can't have a definition of completeness or
perfection.

Balance of the items determined by::
  Personal goals + what's appropriate for the project

=== Enemies
 - Like the sound of your own voice
 - Lack of experience finishing
 - Not being able to differentiate between the core being done vs all possible
   aspects being perfected or even done.
 - Perfectionism at any of steps
 - Overemphasis on one of the steps

=== Payoffs
 - Each level has its own payoffs although the least fulfilling is to endlessly
   repeat one phase across many projects.
 - Doing all the phases == more fulfilling
