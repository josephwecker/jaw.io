== General
http://webtypography.net/toc/

Change actual grid parameters / line-height, etc., based on media queries. Some
degree of flex before having to change actual content.

Beautiful & functional at any size / orientation - verifiably so


== Sizing
- If possible: font-size:100% in body and font-sizes/line-heights in em

  body {
      font-size:100%;
      line-height:1.125em; /* 16Ã—1.125=18 */
  }

  .bodytext p {
      font-size:0.875em;
  }

  .sidenote {
      font-size:0.75em;
  }



== Hyphenation
- Leave at least 2 characters behind and take at least three forward
- Avoid more than three consecutive hyphenated lines
- New algorithm for auto-adjusting lines?




== Microtab
- When whitespace works like a small tab- aligning to pixel.
- Applies to tabs as well.
- Would allow for the use of non-monospaced fonts for source code, etc.
- Possibly apply to brackets. Maybe even make a property of words?

   blah blah blah(one,     two,
                  aligned, also aligned)

- I mean, what needs to be vertically consistent in code these days anyway?



== Numbers
- Separate digits with a narrow space (~ 0.1em)
- Text figures for numbers inside text (e.g., hoefler, georgia)
- Title figures for digits that should be capitalized (like in all-caps
  situations)
- See http://www.graphic-design.com/DTG/bergsland/numbering_typography.html
- http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-variant-numeric-prop supported by
  firefox 4 so far - as long as you have some good opentype fonts.


== Print
- Use best pt sizes for fonts
- Full urls for links
  @media print {
       #main-content a[href]:after { " (" attr(href) ") "; }
  }
- http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/

- Site sizes in pixels -> Monitor dpi (usually 96dpi) -> inches -> / 72 => #pt

== Forms
- To ensure that you can size them and have padding etc. not expand the
  position:

  textarea {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; /* Safari/Chrome, other WebKit */
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;    /* Firefox, other Gecko */
    box-sizing: border-box;         /* Opera/IE 8+ */
  }
