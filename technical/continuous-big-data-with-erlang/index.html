<p>I&#8217;ve come to realize (with apologies to Greenspun) that many sufficiently large
Erlang systems become ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow
implementations of Kahn Process Networks.</p>

<p>A Kahn Process Network, for those unfamiliar, is a formalization of what is
more colloquially known as pipeline programming or flow-based programming. Or
dataflow programming, or stream processing&#8230; In fact, it tends to get
reinvented so often that it has accumulated a large list of names (see the
relevant Wikipedia entries on the right), sometimes with a different emphasis
but all describing essentially the same thing: Sequential (and often parallel)
processing of streaming data.</p>

<p>Many problems map very intuitively to the idea, from very low-level signal
processing chips to unix commandline pipes to continuous business intelligence
(drinking from the data firehose) or (in my case) soft-real-time algorithmic
trading.</p>

<p>In the case of big data, modeling problems as data-flows is often far simpler
than comparable batch-oriented approaches such as using mapreduce or Hadoop- all
while giving the benefit of continuous operation. Add Erlang and you get a
distributed version as well as hot-code swapping for true continuous processing.</p>

<p>Anyway, the problem has come up often enough in my work over the years that I&#8217;ve
decided to finally build out a proper pipeline library for Erlang to make them
as easy and intuitive as possible. In this entry I&#8217;m mostly going to give
background. Subsequent entries will dig into the actual design and
implementation of <a href="https://github.com/josephwecker/kahn">Kahn</a>.</p>

<h2 id="brief-history">Brief History</h2>

<p>Because it has been (and will continue to be) reinvented so often, a very brief
history is in order.  After several years of study and research at Stanford,
Gilles Kahn returned to France and in 1974 published <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/papers/kahn1974semantics.pdf">the
paper</a>
introducing what came to be known as Kahn Process Networks (or KPNs).</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>To put my strongest concerns into a nutshell&#8230; We should have some way of connecting programs like garden hose&#8211;
screw in another segment when it becomes&#8230; necessary to massage data in another way. This is the way of IO also&#8230;</p>

  <footer>&ndash; <cite><a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/mdmpipe.html">M. D. McIlroy,<br /> Oct 1964 as the Multics project was beginning.</a></cite></footer>

</blockquote>

<p>It is a rather straight-forward formalization of work and ideas that had been
percolating mostly over at Bell Labs (thanks, I understand, to McIlroy) related
to operating system design. It took the idea of pipelines, gave them a graph
structure, a nice concise mathematical treatment, and showed that it had some
very desirable behaviors for parallel systems such as operating systems (and as
an academic model of computation).</p>

<p>Even to the team putting Unix together the idea wasn&#8217;t new- Petri nets, for
example, were purportedly invented by Carl Petri in 1939- at the age of 13. Even
assembly lines from the industrial revolution could be argued to have
represented an earlier physical equivalent&#8230; My point is not to try to assign
credit or minimize later contributions- my point is that it&#8217;s such an old and
inuitive way to model progressive state changes that you can put it in the same
category as, for example, functional programming; that is, it has historical
gravitas- it&#8217;s not going away any time soon and when you do it you should take
the time to do it right.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to depart in many ways from the Kahn Process Network as formalized in
the original paper (because, well, this is a practical library and doesn&#8217;t need
to be restricted in order to prove computational properties) but I believe
they&#8217;re the perfect starting point if you want to do pipeline programming
&#8220;right&#8221; and, in this case, for the purposes of sanity checking the architecture
of a dataflow library.</p>

<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>

<p>Despite its many names, we&#8217;re dealing here primarily with problems that can be
modeled with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data flows into a process sequentially, is transformed (probably), and flows back out.</li>
  <li>The process doesn&#8217;t care who it flows in from or out to. That is, each processes is composable and interchangeable.</li>
  <li>Processes are monotonic. They don&#8217;t have to output at the same rate as incoming data, but their output must not
re-order the flow. (Usually this is implemented as a buffered FIFO).</li>
  <li>A system where the algorithms can all be continuous/online. That is, they can&#8217;t access arbitrary past data or rely on
having all the data in hand before outputting something. (For example, some of these <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~marek/pubs/online.bib">papers</a>). </li>
  <li>If a process holds state- ideally it will be steady-state, bounded in size.</li>
  <li>Processes are properly abstracted- they don&#8217;t care who gives them input or who receives their output (implicitly at
least, explicit cycles are fine if you know what you&#8217;re doing)- just that they are of the correct type. Also, like any
good Erlang program, these processes don&#8217;t care about any sort of global state- their state (if any) is purely
determined by the tokens that it has consumed.</li>
  <li>In a proper Kahn Network the processes and therefore network are completely deterministic. This is accomplished by
assuming that writing outputs is always nonblocking but that reading inputs always blocks. This determinism makes
certain analysis very tractable. We have two caveats:
    <ul>
      <li>Our Kahn network implementation basically uses Erlang&#8217;s message-passing semantics, so token matching, blocking for a
certain amount of time, waiting for certain data, etc.- are all possible if you really want. Even then most of then
most of the time we&#8217;ll still be deterministic, but in theory the Erlang VM could, on a second run using the exact
same processes and tokens, timeslice the processes in such a way that a &#8216;receive after &#8230;&#8217; statement gets triggered
where on the earlier run it did not. In other words, as soon as you include &#8216;after&#8217; (or, worse, look at the incoming
message queue and detect a token without consuming it- usually frowned on anyway in Erlang) you&#8217;re system is no
longer technically deterministic (and no longer technically a Kahn Process Network). So far in practice though I&#8217;ve
found this to be rarely needed and easily accounted for.</li>
      <li>Erlang&#8217;s message queues (equivalent to the channels or buffered FIFO structures between processes) are bounded by
available physical memory. To ensure things stay balanced and that no queue gets too big, we&#8217;ll occasionally (with a
possible warning) block for a moment when sending the output from a process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What Erlang adds to the mix: Natural semantic fit, supervisors and fault tolerance, easy scalability over multiple
machines, easily integrated visualization and high-level graph analysis, type-checking, hot-code-swapping, &amp; lots of
other Erlang goodness. Also, because this is a practical endeavor and not an academic or theoretical endeavor, the
ability to dynamically create and remove, connect and disconnect, update and restart individual processes on the fly
will be available.</p>

<h2 id="some-terminology">Some Terminology</h2>

<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>

<p>The first problem- what to name these data-flow processes- the nodes in the data-flow graph&#8230;</p>

<ul>
  <li>&#8220;Process&#8221; - Nope, used. In Erlang it already refers to the primitive light-weight processes that are ubiquitous in Erlang-
            our Kahn processes will often be Erlang processes but we can&#8217;t call them the same thing.</li>
  <li>&#8220;Node&#8221;    - Used. Also already used by Erlang to describe a separate Erlang VM, possibly running on a separate machine
            across a network.</li>
  <li>&#8220;Module&#8221;  - Used.</li>
  <li>&#8220;Vertex&#8221;  - Meh. It makes sense from a graph-theory point of view but is long and a bit too generic.</li>
  <li>&#8220;Stage&#8221;   - Meh. Would work except that it implies the process always does some form of staging or transformation-
            not generic enough.</li>
  <li>&#8220;Function/Fun/Fn/Lambda&#8230;&#8221; - Can&#8217;t. As we&#8217;ll see, they tend to be much more like state machines (or in some cases
            gen-servers) with several functions- which would make calling it something like a function, even though it
            will hopefully be composable like a function, a misnomer.</li>
</ul>

<p>To distinguish from Erlang processes and nodes, then, I&#8217;m simply going to call these data-flow processes &#8216;nodum&#8217;
(or usually the singular, &#8216;nodus&#8217;); the root word for node; Latin for knot. There will be three primary ways to define
or implement a nodus:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using an Erlang function (either anonymous or by name) for nodum that are simple enough to be implemented in a simple
loop (like multiplying two incoming values or other primitives).</li>
  <li>Using an Erlang external port&#8217;s input/output (if you want a more complicated port write a nodus module)- that is, a
straightforward way to insert a system command into the flow just like a Unix pipeline.</li>
  <li>Using the <code>-behaviour(nodus)</code> directive in a module that implements the proper callbacks which can act basically as a
state-machine or server, receiving messages and outputting responses as appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ports">Ports</h3>

<p>Not to be confused with Erlang Ports (basically external interfaces), we&#8217;ll say that each Nodus has any number of input
ports and any number of output ports- each named and with a type specification that determines what kind of token it
accepts.</p>

<h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>

<p>Equivalent to Erlang messages in the following form: <code>{token, InPort, FromPID, Data}</code> where the InPort is an atom that
corresponds to one of the recipient nodus&#8217; input-ports, the FromPID is an Erlang PID for the sending nodus and the
Data is any term that matches the type for that input-port.</p>

<p>With state</p>
