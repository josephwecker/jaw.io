## Intro

Like 99% of you, I've always been meaning to get around to blogging[^blogging].
I've half written dozens of different entries in my head over the years, always
with a smile and nod to myself- "yeah, that entry would be awesome." Anyway,
you'll have to take my word for it- they _were_ awesome. Now though I'm going
to start writing them[^logging], and to give myself some sense of momentum I'm
going to publish this as my first entry. Just this single lonely paragraph.
With some disclaimers. Without any real point to make except maybe "look- I'm
not procrastinating my blog any longer."

## Disclaimers

These apply to all entries that will eventually exist on the site:

* I reserve the right to change my mind about anything I write, especially as
  new information is made available.[^info]
* All entries, with the possible exception of this one, are meant to be
  genuinely edifying to fellow-geeks. If I'm ever guilty of dishonest writing
  or writing filled with naive baseless conjectures (unless marked as such) in
  order to pander to some tech news aggregation service or other- feel free to
  shame me. Private shamings are generally more effective with me (it's easier
  for me to discount bravado or trollishness as a motivator for the comment)
  but public shamings are appropriate if rational and polite[^possible] since
  my errors are obviously public.

[^blogging]: Not normal blogging; geek blogging. Glogging, as it were.
[^logging]: "logging" them, as it were.
[^info]: Or I am made aware of old information that everyone seemed to know but me.
[^possible]: No, it's not impossible to shame politely.
