The Kano Model has been a general part of Six Sigma methodologies since the
80's and like much of the rest of Six Sigma it has been watered down over the
decades with enough fluffy managementese to render it almost invisible,
especially to fields where it hasn't traditionally been applied like software
engineering and startups. It is, however, a very powerful customer satisfaction
model that has very important implications- _particularly_ for software-related
startups.

The Model
-----------

Imagine a simple chart where you were going to map out all the various features
and aspects of your site or business from a customer's perspective, with the
goal of getting an overall aggregate picture of how that software or service
"makes people feel," (which of course you could correlate with demand, loyalty,
growth, fan-boy fervency, etc.)

The model can be used at various scales, and, at least initially, it's useful
to think of it purely as a revealing mental model. The ability to get more
precision and validation for the model will be (at least as far as this post is
concerned) left as an excercise for the reader.
