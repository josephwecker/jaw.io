# Data for http://jw.ws

This is the data for my personal site. Rake tasks convert haml/sass into
layouts and styles, then jekyll finishes creating the static site when pushed
to github. See http://pages.github.com/ for more info in general and feel free
especially to copy the layout of the files here and the Rakefile/Gemfile if you
need to do something similar.
